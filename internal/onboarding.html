        <h1 id="welcometojakt">Welcome to JAKT</h1>

        <p>Welcome! Here is a document covering a variety of computer setup and programming related questions that will help our team work best together.</p>

        <p>This is a living document, changes, additions are expected and encouraged. If you find a section is lacking make some changes and submit a pull request.</p>

        <h2 id="beforeyourfirstday">Before Your First Day</h2>

        <p>These things need to be completed before you come in on Day 1.</p>

        <h3 id="paperwork.">Paperwork.</h3>

        <p>Paperwork generally sucks but it is important for the government and our lawyers / accountants. Some requisite documents:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Current, up-to-date NDA.</li>
            <li>For 1099 employees, a valid contract.</li>
            <li>For all paid employees, a complete W&#8211;9 form.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can find all these forms in the company dropbox under
            <code>Documents/Forms</code>.</p>

        <p>Speaking of Dropbox.</p>

        <h3 id="accountssetup">Accounts Setup</h3>

        <p>You will need an
            <code>@byjakt.com</code>Google Apps account. This encorporates your email and calendaring. Bug <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#106;&#x6f;&#x73;&#x68;&#64;&#98;&#121;&#x6a;&#97;&#107;&#x74;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#74;&#111;&#x73;&#104;</a> if you have not received an invite to Google Apps.</p>

        <h4 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h4>

        <p>You will also need to be added to our Company Dropbox account. We have Dropbox for Business that allows you to keep both your personal
            <em>and</em>our company Dropbox accounts without merging them.</p>

        <p>Once you have Dropbox setup it would be a good time to browse around and see how the folders are structured. Yes, in a perfect world perhaps we could
            <a href="http://ia.net/blog/mountain-lions-new-file-system/">remove the concept of nested folders</a> but for now there is a very general layout of how things are structured.</p>

        <pre>
            <code>├── Clients Client projects folder ├── Forms Legal and other forms ├── Personnel Personal folders for each employee │ └── YOUR NAME Your personal folder ├── Assets Various purchased assets including images and fonts. └── Books Various purchased books, good for reading

        <h4 id="fogbugzkiln">FogBugz &amp; Kiln</h4>

        <p>We&#8217;ll be giving you access to our bug tracking and scm solution. These are handled by FogBugz and Kiln. See the section&#8217;s below entitled
            <a href="#workingwithfogbugz">Working with FogBugz</a> and
            <a href="#developmentworkflowwithkiln">Development Workflow with Kiln</a> below.</p>

        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

        <p>Clear and constant communication is a priority for our team. We have a short (&lt;3 minutes) daily standup at 10:15am every morning. You have ~20 seconds to explain what you&#8217;ve completed, what you&#8217;re working on, and what (if any) issues are blocking you. Here are three main communication tools we use at JAKT.</p>

        <h4 id="email">Email</h4>

        <p>You will be given an
            <code>@byjakt.com</code>. You should be in the habit of checking your email a few times a day. Email is not a reliable real-time messaging platform but often people expect replies quickly. If something more urgent comes up, you are expected to be available on the common real-time messaging platforms below:</p>

        <h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>

        <p>Slack is a team communication service that integrates with many different services. The core of Slack is built around an IRC-style layout with various channels that are used. Direct messaging is enabled as well. There are web, desktop, and mobile clients available.</p>

        <h4 id="messages">Messages</h4>

        <p>Messages is an Apple-only messaging client that supports the following account types out of the box:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>iMessages (for iOS and iCloud users)</li>
            <li>Google Talk</li>
            <li>Other jabber accounts</li>
            <li>AIM</li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="othersolutions">Other Solutions</h4>

        <p>We&#8217;re actively investigating new solutions that will help us communicate better. If you stumble across one that looks good let us know!</p>

        <h2 id="workingwithfogbugz">Working with FogBugz</h2>

        <p>There isn&#8217;t very formalized process for using FogBguz. I&#8217;m detailing some basic guidelines for how we use it but one of the best resources for you to go over is the FogBugz help desk, especially the
            <a href="http://help.fogcreek.com/4/fogbugz-in-two-minutes">FogBugz in Two Minutes</a> video.</p>

        <h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

        <p>We create one project per client. All cases for a project go within here.</p>

        <h4 id="areas">Areas</h4>

        <p>Areas within a project are used to separate logical types of work. For starters each project will have an area called “Misc.” As the project grows we will expand the number of areas slowly to accommodate certain filters or grouping of cases.
        </p>

        <h4 id="category">Category</h4>

        <p>The type of case. They are relatively self-explanatory.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Bug</strong>is for bugs.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Feature</strong>is for improvements or additions.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Task</strong>is for things that are not features or bugs (use sparingly).</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Inquiry</strong>is for research or customer requests.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Schedule Item</strong>is for meetings or other misc. time spent on that project.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="casestatuskanban">Case Status &amp; Kanban</h4>

        <p>Each category has different statuses you can assign it. The three major statuses are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Active</strong>Case is active.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Resolved</strong>Case is considered complete by the person who resolved it.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Closed</strong>Case is closed out, deployed, and confirmed. Typically you will not be closing cases, only resolving and assigning them to your team lead for deployment and closure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you open a case for someone else to complete it is there responsibility to resolve it and assign it back to you. At that point it&#8217;s your responsibility to verify that the case is complete and close it out.</p>

        <p>The kanban board is used to track the status of cases as they move through the system. Currently there are six columns:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Proposed</strong>The case is proposed. This is the initial state for any new case unless immediate action is being taken upon it.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Approved</strong>When a case is assigned to you it is your responsibility to give that case an estimate and due date. Once this is done move the case to approved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>In Progress</strong>When starting work on a case first double check to make sure the estimated time is accurate. Then move the case to
                <em>In Progress</em>and start time for the case.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ready for Testing</strong>When a case is complete resolve it and at the same time move the case to the
                <em>Ready for Testing</em>column. This indicates that you believe the case to be complete. When resolving the case it will default to the person who opened it. Ensure this is the correct person to be checking your work.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ready to Ship</strong>For cases that require a deployment step, once they are tested move it to this column until the next release occurs.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Shipped</strong>Cases that are deployed or finalized are added here. When a case is moved to
                <em>Shipped</em>it should be closed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Currently we are experimenting with the kanban colors. Right now there is a color for each major project. There is an
            <em>Other</em>color (white) that is used if there is not a project color. In the future this might change.</p>

        <h4 id="assignedto">Assigned To</h4>

        <p>Who is currently responsible for handling the case. Cases can be passed through team leads and onto individual developers or they may be directly assigned. If a case is assigned to you and you believe it is better handled by someone else or more information is required make a note when editing and assign it to the new person. Keep in mind you should be moving it back to the
            <em>Proposed</em>kanban column when doing so.</p>

        <h4 id="priority">Priority</h4>

        <p>Current priority of the case. When in doubt, work on highest (1 high, 7 low) priority cases before lower priority cases.</p>

        <h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

        <p>Milestones are used to track progress towards an finalized release. Typically this is a version number but other milestones are possible. There is a global milestone available to all projects called
            <em>Undecided</em>. If a project does not have a milestone configured it will be assigned to this milestone.</p>

        <h4 id="otherfields">Other Fields</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Parent Case</strong>Parent case (makes this case a subcase)</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Subcase</strong>Subcases (makes this case a parent case)</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Due</strong>Date and time this case is estimated to be done by.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Estimate</strong>Estimated time it will take to resolve this case. FogBugz enables
                <a href="https://help.fogcreek.com/9121/which-estimates-are-used-by-ebs">evidence based scheduling</a> so all cases must have an estimate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="developmentworkflowwithkiln">Development Workflow with Kiln</h2>

        <p>We&#8217;re using Kiln because it&#8217;s enables our development teams to use git or mercurial as they like. It gives us the ability to branch repositories cleanly, perform code reviews with sign-offs, and it ties into our case management system in FogBugz.</p>

        <h4 id="startingaproject">Starting a Project</h4>

        <p>All developers will have their own branch repositories off of the main repository. This repository is your playground; you are free to merge and rebase commit history to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>

        <p>That said, the main repository is a church. Everything in it is holy and must be treated with the utmost respect. Code is not allowed to enter the pearly gates of the main repository until it has been subjected to a
            <a href="http://help.fogcreek.com/8268/code-reviews-in-kiln">code review</a>. Code reviews aren&#8217;t scary, in fact they are one of the fun points of the job. Anyone can perform a code review, however it&#8217;s best if <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#115;&#104;&#64;&#98;&#x79;&#x6a;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x74;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#74;&#x6f;&#115;&#x68;</a> is the main reviewer until the development team expands.</p>

        <p>To start off a project, create a branch repository from the main one in Kiln. Name it with YOUR NAME. Done, you&#8217;re ready to <a href="#workingonacase">work on a case</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="workingonacase">Working on a Case</h4>

        <p>A quick workflow for working on a particular feature or bug:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Find the relevant case in FogBugz. If no case exists, <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#106;&#x6f;&#x73;&#104;&#64;&#x62;&#121;&#106;&#x61;&#x6b;&#116;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#98;&#x75;&#103; &#x73;&#111;&#109;&#101;&#111;&#110;&#x65;</a>
                about why a case doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the case estimate is correct and move the case to the
                <em>In Progress
                </em> <a href="#casestatuskanban">kanban column</a>.</li>
            <li>Start time on the case, even if this isn&#8217;t a client project and it&#8217;s only internal.
            </li>
            <li>Open up your branch repository and consider creating a new branch for this case. For major features definitely. For minor changes, maybe not. We use a convention for naming cases:
                <code>NUMBER_some_description</code>. Branches are prefixed with the FogBugz case number, then an underscore, then a short description replacing spaces and non-ascii characters with underscores.</li>
            <li>Make sure this branch is synced with your branch repository (
                <code>git push -t origin 123_example_branch</code>).</li>
            <li>Work and make commits frequently remembering to make a note of the case number in the commit message. If there isn&#8217;t a good place to put it, creating a line at the bottom of the commit message in the form
                <code>Ref case NUMBER</code>is perfectly acceptable.</li>
            <li>Push work frequently to your branch repository. It doesn&#8217;t do a distributed system any good if your work isn&#8217;t pushed.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 5 &amp; 6 until the feature is complete.</li>
            <li>Restructure your commit history to your liking. Convention is to rebase your smaller commits into a few larger more detailed commits ammending the commit messages to be more detailed.</li>
            <li>Request a code review of your branch repository.</li>
            <li>Once the review is complete, merge your code into your master branch and then your master branch will be merged with the main repository.</li>
            <li>Resolve the case and assign it to the person in charge of deployments for that project.</li>
            <li>Once the new code is deployed the case will be closed.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That&#8217;s our
            <strike>12</strike>13 step workflow for working on a case using FogBugz and Kiln.</p>
